# Federal Money for Urban Blood:  Urban Renewal's Contribution to the 1960s Surge in Homicides

## Abstract
From the 1960s to the 1990s, murder rates in the United States nearly doubled. Starting in 1957, homicides were the lowest since World War II at a rate of 4 per 100,000. In the decade between 1963 and 1974, homicide rates zoomed from 4.6 to 9.8. They peaked in 1980 at 10.2. The homicide rate bounced down to 9.79 in 1991, only to plummet for a decade. Scholars have proposed many reasons for the surge in violence. Their theories pointed to a variety of social and psychological suspects. But they overlooked an obvious variable: urban renewal. 

Urban renewal was a large and expensive government effort aimed at transforming cities. It changed cities by buying properties, displacing families, demolishing buildings, and constructing places. These changes created new opportunities for offenders to find unguarded suitable targets. Its crime-creating mechanisms were removing the incentives for property owners to manage their places, shifting crime target locations, introducing users, and creating new daily routines. When urban renewal was enacted at modest levels, it did not create violence and may have protected against it. But when inflicted on a large scale, it resulted in many unnecessary killings. 

I reached these conclusions after conducting the first study of urban renewal’s impact on homicides between 1954 and 1974. I used the following datasets: Federal Bureau of Investigation Uniform Crime Reports, the Federal Government’s Urban Renewal Directory, the County and City Data Book, New York City homicide data (Monkkonen, 2006), and Governmental Responses to Crime (Jacob, 1992). Regardless of all the social factors, urban renewal cannot be ignored as a prime suspect in the rise in crime.

This dissertation contains two studies. First, I tested the impact of urban renewal on homicide rates across the United States using a negative binomial mixed model. The models showed that a city completing a few projects decreased the homicide rate. However, when cities massively invest in urban renewal, the return on investment can be measured in homicides. 

My second study looks at New York City. New York City spent more on urban renewal than any other city. Therefore, it deserves special treatment. I used a time-series negative binomial to estimate the effects of non-white resident displacement, ongoing projects, project completion, funds dispersed and reserved, and intervention effects on homicides. The case study supported urban renewal’s influence. 

My dissertation makes three contributions. First, it examines the impact of urban renewal on homicide. Second, my results suggest a dosage effect. On modest scales, urban renewal may have saved lives. But on a large scale, urban renewal destroyed lives. Third, my results suggest that removing places, displacing residents, and restructuring daily routines alters the spatial-temporal aspect of homicides. Urban renewal removed places entirely, changed land use, and shifted populations. These alterations in the physical and social environments changed where offenders and targets gathered.
